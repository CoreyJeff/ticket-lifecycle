Step 1: Open a osTicket Support Center tab in your Virtual machine using this link (http://localhost/osTicket/) and Log in. Next you will open a ticket and use the email we made last section (karen@osticket.com) and username (Karen Karen). Set the Help Topic to Business Critical Outage and under summary put "Entire mobile banking is down". In details put "Customers are reporting they are getting 404 error while using mobile banking app then create the ticket. When the ticket is finished log out of the account.

Step 3: Click your Karen ticket you made and review it. Start by changing the Priority from normal to Emergency and in the notes put Buisness impacting event. Next assign the ticket to yourself and change the SLA Plan to (Sev-A). Now you will reset the department to System Administators in the notes put "Sys Admins are responsible for banking infustructure". Scroll down to the bottom of the ticket and in Response details put "Coordinating with Sys Admin Team to bring mobile banking back online" and Post Reply.
